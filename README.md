# OregonTrail1978
'Oregon Trail' as Printed in the May/June 1978 Edition of Creative Computing Magazine

The source code was modified in a few areas by myself (Christopher Pedersen) in 2018
in order to make the program compatible with the version of BASIC which I'm currently
running on my own personal computer-- Chipmunk BASIC (http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/).

Please note that I have not quite yet worked out all of the bugs in the program.
The version of BASIC which I'm currently running is intended to be compatible
with the old type-in-source-code-from-magazines programs, but there are a few
areas here and there that apparently are not compatible. And while the program
I've posted here to Github will run, I believe some of the bugs I encountered 
playing the game are due to a few places in the program where the code is not
returning the expected values due to differences between versions of BASIC.
However, maybe the bugs are my fault? Either way, I hope to have all the bugs
worked out soon and will update the code here accordingly.
