# OregonTrail1978
'Oregon Trail' as Printed in the May/June 1978 Edition of Creative Computing Magazine

The source code was modified in a few areas by myself (Christopher Pedersen) in 2018
in order to make the program compatible with the version of BASIC which I'm currently
running on my own personal computer-- Chipmunk BASIC (http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/).
