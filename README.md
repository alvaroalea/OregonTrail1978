'Oregon Trail' as Printed in the May/June 1978 Issue of Creative Computing Magazine

This is a modification by Alvaro Alea on 2019 of the modification of Christopher Pedersen 
in order to execute on a 8bits's Sinclair ZX Spectrum Computer
The source code must be compiled with Boriel's ZX Basic Compiler (http://boriel.com/wiki/en/index.php/ZXBasic)

There is also a version for Sinclair QL

MILESTONES:

- V0.1 -> Make it Completely playable as in 1978 edition
- V0.2 -> Make it Screen-driven instead of text-driven
- V0.3 -> Include options of moderms versions, like name of people, works, and expecial places
- V0.4 -> Graphics!
- V0.5 -> Interactive Hunt
- V0.6 -> Time tell...


The source code was modified in a few areas by myself (Christopher Pedersen) in 2018
in order to make the program compatible with the version of BASIC which I'm currently
running on my own personal computer-- Chipmunk BASIC (http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/).
